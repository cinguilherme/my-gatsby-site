## this is my site using gatsby as a study project. Also this will be my go to platform to test new apis

### this was originally created using the Gatsby CLI new default project.

#### The main goal of this site is just to be a platform to consume most of my other projects, several restfull apis.. wasm stuff.. I realise Gatsby is meant to static stuff but I feel like it is a joy to buuild like several of small SPAs. Like I can have a single page(feature for any of the off board stuff) This sounds interesting to be that just want that.
